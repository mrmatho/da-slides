# What is personal information?

*From the Australian Government Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) - https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information*

Personal information includes a broad range of information, or an opinion, that could identify an individual. What is personal information will vary, depending on whether a person can be identified or is reasonably identifiable in the circumstances.

For example, personal information may include:

- an individual’s name, signature, address, phone number or date of birth
- sensitive information
- credit information
- employee record information
- photographs
- internet protocol (IP) addresses
- voice print and facial recognition biometrics (because they collect characteristics that make an individual’s voice or face unique)
- location information from a mobile device (because it can reveal user activity patterns and habits).

# What does that mean for my data collection?

- You need to be aware of the type of data you are collecting and how it may be used.
- Our strong preference is to avoid collecting sensitive information at all, and not to collect personal information unless it is absolutely necessary.
- If we do collect personal information, we need to ensure that it is stored securely and disposed of securely, and that we communicate clearly to the people we are collecting data from how their data will be used.
