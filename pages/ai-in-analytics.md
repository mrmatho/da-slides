# From the Study Design

emerging trends in data analytics using artificial intelligence, including:

- integration of artificial intelligence features into software tools
- generating data visualisations through the writing and refinement of prompts
- machine learning and statistical modelling for making predictions, decisions and recommendations

# Integration of AI Features into Software Tools

- AI features are being integrated into software tools to enhance the capabilities of the tools.
- For example, AI features can be used to automate the process of data analysis, by automatically generating insights from data.
- AI features can also be used to enhance the user experience of the software tools, by providing intelligent recommendations and suggestions to the user.
- These AI features include a combination of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques.

# Generating Data Visualisations through the Writing and Refinement of Prompts

- Data visualisations are an important tool for communicating insights from data.
- AI techniques can be used to generate data visualisations automatically, through submitting and refining prompts to large language models. 
    - For example, a user can submit a prompt like "show me a bar chart of the sales data by region", and the AI model can generate the data visualisation based on the prompt.
    - This can help users to quickly explore and understand their data, without needing to manually create the visualisations themselves. It reduces the level of expertise required to create data visualisations.
- These models may also provide code snippets (or even complete code) to generate the visualisation in a programming language like Python.

# Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling for Making Predictions, Decisions and Recommendations

- Machine learning and statistical modelling techniques are being used to make predictions, decisions, and recommendations based on data.
    - For example, machine learning models can be used to predict customer churn, recommend products to customers, or make decisions about resource allocation.
- These models can be trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships in the data, and then used to make predictions on new data. 
    - Unlike many of the statistical analyses we investigate in Data Analytics which are usually comparing just two variables, machine learning models can consider a significant number of different variables simultaneously to make predictions or recommendations.
- Common machine learning techniques include regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning.

# AI Risks and Ethical Considerations

- As AI is more used in data analytics, there are risks and ethical issues to consider.
- A key risk is bias in AI models, which can lead to unfair outcomes.
    - AI models are trained on historical data, which always has some bias. If not fixed, this bias can continue in the AI model and cause biased predictions or decisions.
- Other ethical issues include AI models invading privacy, violating human rights, or being used for harmful purposes.
    - AI models are trained on data that may not have been collected ethically or with consent. This can cause privacy issues and misuse of AI models.
    - Using AI tools in data analytics can unintentionally share private information with third parties without the knowledge or consent of the data subjects.
