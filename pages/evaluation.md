# VCE Data Analytics: School-assessed Task 2025

## Unit 4 Outcome 1  
### 10. Skills in evaluating the solution and assessing the project plan.

| Indicators | 1–2 (very low) | 3–4 (low) | 5–6 (medium) | 7–8 (high) | 9–10 (very high) |
|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Documents the evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations.** | Identifies measures to evaluate whether the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations have met solution requirements. | Outlines the evaluation criteria from Criterion 4 required to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations. | Uses the evaluation criteria from Criterion 4 to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations, and the extent to which it meets the functional and non-functional requirements. | Explains how the evaluation criteria has been measured to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations. | Proposes an evaluation strategy to be conducted sometime in the future to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations that includes: the time frame for the evaluation to be conducted; the evaluation criteria to be used. |
| **Documents evidence of critical and creative thinking through the evaluation of the analysis, design and development stages and improvements to the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations.** | Identifies features of the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations that meet functional and non-functional requirements. | Outlines the process of developing the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations through the analysis, design and development stages. | Evaluates the use of the analysis, design and development stages in developing the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations. | Critically evaluates the process of developing the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations, from start to finish, through the analysis, design and development stages, and how this process assisted in meeting requirements. | Discusses and justifies improvements that could be made to the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations by approaching the analysis, design and development stages differently. |
