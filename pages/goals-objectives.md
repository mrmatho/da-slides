# Goals

Organisational goals are *broad*, primary outcomes that an organisation aims to achieve. They provide a general direction and purpose for the organisation.

Examples of organisational goals include:

- Enhance customer satisfaction

# Objectives

Objectives are the *specific*, measurable steps that an organisation takes to achieve its goals. They are more detailed and time-bound than goals.

Examples of organisational objectives include:

- Increase sales by 15% in the next fiscal year
- Achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 90% or higher in the next survey
- Launch three new products in the next six months
- Reduce carbon emissions by 25% over the next five years

# Relationship Between Goals and Objectives

- Goals provide the overall direction and purpose for the organisation.
- Objectives are always aligned with meeting one or more organisational goals.
- Objectives are specific and measurable steps that help achieve the broader goals.
- Goals are usually long-term, while objectives are typically short to medium-term.

# Data Integrity and Organisational Goals and Objectives

- We study goals and objectives because poor data integrity can have a significant impact on an organisation's ability to achieve its goals and objectives.
- Once we understand the goals and objectives of an organisation, we can better assess how data integrity issues may affect their ability to meet these targets.
- For example, if an organisation has a goal to increase customer satisfaction, poor data integrity in customer records could lead to miscommunication and dissatisfaction among customers.
- Similarly, if an organisation has an objective to increase sales by a certain percentage, inaccurate sales data could lead to misguided strategies and missed targets.
