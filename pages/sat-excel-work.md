|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Use spreadsheet software tools to manipulate and cleanse data.** | Uses spreadsheet software tools to identify data for manipulation and cleansing. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to import data from database software tools using a range of data types. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to apply conditional formatting. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to link between worksheets. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to format all data and charts for export to infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations. |
|            | Uses spreadsheet software tools to create worksheets. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to apply a range of appropriate formats to data. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to filter data using criteria or sort data using one field/column. | Uses spreadsheet software tools to sort data using multiple fields/columns. | All errors with data and/or calculations have been identified and corrected. |
|            |                |           | Uses spreadsheet software tools for manipulating data using formulas. |            |                    |
|            |                |           | Some errors exist with data and/or calculations. Few errors have been corrected. | Minor errors exist with data and/or calculations. Some errors have been corrected. |                    |

| **Applies appropriate validation techniques.** | Identifies input data for validation. | Validates data using one of the following checks: existence, type, range. | Validates data using two of the following checks: existence, type, range. Some inconsistencies are present. | Validates data using all the following checks: existence, type, range. Minor inconsistencies are present. | Validates all relevant input data and checks the reasonableness and completeness of all input data. No inconsistencies are present. |
| **Use of statistical analysis to identify trends, relationships and patterns.** | Lists manual calculations to be used for statistical analysis. | Illustrates calculations using formulas to be used for statistical analysis. | Calculates descriptive statistics using formulas and describes each statistic. | Calculates descriptive statistics related to the measures of variability and the spread of the data. | Calculates all relevant descriptive statistics correctly and accurately. |
|            | Identifies trends in the data. | Creates charts to enable statistical analysis. | Creates relevant charts that accurately depict the data. | Examines the statistics and describes its relevance. | Explains reasons for the shape and skew of data accurately. |

# So what is important?

- You have to **show** that you have:
    - Applied conditional formatting to data.
    - Linked data between worksheets.
    - Got data in a format for export to infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations.
    - Sorted data using more than one column (ie - this then that)
    - Validated: existence, type, range.
    - Calculated **lots of** descriptive statistics (not just the ones you will use in your visualisation)
    - Demonstrated skew and shape of data.
        - Histogram and/or scatter plot, with description of skew and shape.
        - Just the graph is not enough.
    - Calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
        - Use it to explain the relationship between data variables.
    - Identify any trends and patterns in the data.

It is not enough to have done them, they have to be **shown in what you submit**.

# How can I show this?

- The spreadsheet itself will show lots
- Provide a description of anything you have done that doesn't appear to be obvious
