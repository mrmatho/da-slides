The five errors were:
- Error 1 – Task A and Task B cannot occur at the same time.
- Error 2 – Task C starts on 3 February and finishes on 5 February, but this cannot occur as Georgie is attending a conference on 5 February so will not be able to work on this day. Task C will now need to start on 3 February and will now finish on 8 February. All other dependent tasks will also need to be moved forward by one day.
- Error 3 – Task E is not linked to Task F. Task E and Task F need to be linked with an arrow/line to show that Task F is dependent on Task E.
- Error 4 – The dependency arrows from Task G are not correct; the arrow needs to go to the back of Task H.
- Error 5 – The milestone, Task L, is shown as completed on 26 February, but it should show as completed on 24 February.

**To gain marks, students needed to circle the whole section of the error. For Error 2, a number of students only circled either Task E or Task F, yet both tasks needed to be circled to gain marks.**

Average marks: a) 2.1/3, b) 1.6/3

# Suveys
- A survey is a method of collecting data by asking people questions.
- Surveys can be used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. 
    - Qualitative data is descriptive and can be used to understand people's thoughts and feelings. 
    - Quantitative data is numerical and can be used to measure things like frequency or amount.
- Surveys can be used to collect data from a large number of people quickly and easily. Data collected from a survey has the advantage of being clearly structured and easy to analyze.
- Surveys can be used to collect data from a wide range of people, including those who may not be able to participate in other types of research, such as interviews or focus groups.
- Surveys miss out on the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, which can be useful for clarifying responses or exploring topics in more depth. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the context behind the data collected.
- Surveys can be biased if the questions are not well-designed or if the sample of people surveyed is not representative of the population being studied.

# Observation
- Observation is a method of collecting data by watching people or events in their natural environment.
- Observation can be used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. 
- Observation includes using recording tools such as video cameras, audio recorders, and other devices to capture data. It could alson include using tools like thermometers, stopwatches, and other measuring devices to collect data.
- Observation can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if the researcher needs to observe a large number of people or events over a long period of time.
- Observation can be biased if the researcher has preconceived notions or expectations about what they will observe. This can lead to selective observation, where the researcher only sees what they expect to see and misses important information.
- Observation can be intrusive, especially if the researcher is observing people in their natural environment. This can lead to ethical concerns about privacy and consent.
- Observation data can be less structured or organized, making it more difficult to analyze.

# Interviews

- Interviews are a method of collecting data by asking people questions in a one-on-one setting.
- Interviews can be used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data, but most interview data will be qualitative.
- Interviews can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. 
    - Structured interviews have a set list of questions that are asked in the same order for each participant. 
    - Semi-structured interviews have a set list of questions but allow for some flexibility in the order and wording of the questions. 
    - Unstructured interviews have no set list of questions and allow for a more open-ended conversation between the interviewer and participant.
- Interviews allow for more in-depth exploration of topics and can provide valuable insights into people's thoughts and feelings.
- Data from interviews can be more difficult to analyze than data from surveys or observation, as it is often less structured and more open-ended.
