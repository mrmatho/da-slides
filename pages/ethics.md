    - identity theft
    - lack of transparency in the event of a cyber security incident

# A simple ethical framework

- **Who are the stakeholders?**
    - Who will be affected by the decision or action?
- **What are the potential consequences?**
    - What are the possible outcomes of the decision or action?
    - Who experiences harm or benefit?
- **What are the ethical principles involved?**
    - Consider principles such as honesty, fairness, respect for privacy, and responsibility.
- **What alternatives are there for action?**
    - Are there other ways to achieve the same goal that may be more ethical?

- Stakeholders: Individuals whose identities may be stolen (and their families or friends), organisations responsible for data security, and law enforcement agencies.
- Consequences: Financial loss, emotional distress, and damage to reputation for individuals; legal, reputational and financial repercussions for organisations.

# Lack of Transparency in the Event of a Cyber Security Incident (Examples of following the framework)

- Issue: Organisations failing to be transparent about cyber security incidents, leading to mistrust and potential harm to affected individuals.
- Stakeholders: Affected individuals, organisations experiencing the incident, regulatory bodies, and the general public.
- Consequences: Loss of trust, legal consequences, and potential harm to individuals if they are not informed about risks to their data.
- Ethical Principles: Honesty, transparency, and accountability.
- Alternatives: Establishing clear communication protocols for cyber security incidents, being transparent about the nature and impact of incidents, and providing support to affected individuals.
