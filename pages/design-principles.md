# Design Principles

Design principles that influence the appearance and functionality of infographics and dynamic data visualizations include:


<img src="/img/design-principles.png" alt="Design Principles" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- alignment
- balance
- contrast
- image use
- space
- text and table formatting
- usability
- navigation
- interactivity

# Alignment

<img src="/img/alignment.png" alt="Alignment" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Alignment refers to the placement of elements in relation to each other and the overall layout
- Proper alignment creates a sense of order and organization, making it easier for users to understand the information presented
- It helps guide the viewer's eye and creates a visual hierarchy, emphasizing important elements

If alignment is missing, the design can appear chaotic and disorganized, making it difficult for users to navigate and comprehend the information.

# Balance

<img src="/img/balance.png" alt="Balance" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Balance refers to the distribution of **visual weight** within a design
- It can be achieved through symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangements of elements
- A balanced design creates a sense of stability and harmony, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate

If balance is missing, the design can feel lopsided or unbalanced, leading to confusion and frustration for users.

# Contrast

<img src="/img/contrast.png" alt="Contrast" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Contrast refers to the difference between elements, such as color, size, and shape
- It helps to highlight important information and create visual interest
- Effective use of contrast can draw attention to key elements and improve readability

If contrast is missing, important information may blend into the background, making it difficult for users to distinguish between different elements and understand the message being conveyed.

# Image Use

<img src="/img/image-use.png" alt="Image Use" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Images can enhance the visual appeal of a design and help convey complex information more effectively
- They should be used purposefully and in ways directly relevant to the content
- Images can help clarify the context, enhance the message, and engage the audience

If images are used excessively or inappropriately, they can distract from the main message and overwhelm the viewer, leading to confusion and disengagement.

# Space

<img src="/img/space.png" alt="Space" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Space refers to the area around and between elements in a design
- Proper use of space helps to create a clean and organized layout, making it easier for users to focus on the content
- It can also help to separate different sections and create a sense of hierarchy

If space is not used effectively, the design can feel cluttered and overwhelming or incomplete and sparse, making it difficult for users to navigate and understand the information presented.

# Text and Table Formatting

<img src="/img/text-and-table.png" alt="Text and Table Formatting" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Text and table formatting refers to the way text and data are presented in a design
- Formatting includes font choice, size, color, and alignment, as well as the organization of tables and data
- Common table formatting includes the use of headers, borders, and alternating row colors to improve readability
- Effective text and table formatting enhances readability, comprehension, and overall user experience

If text and table formatting is inconsistent or poorly executed, it can lead to visual confusion and misinterpretation of information.

# Usability

<img src="/img/usability.png" alt="Usability" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Usability refers to how easy and intuitive a design is for users to interact with
- A usable design allows users to navigate, understand, and interact with the content without confusion or frustration
- It includes considerations such as clear labeling, intuitive navigation, and responsive design
- A key element of usability is ensuring that interactive elements follow established conventions so they behave exactly as users expect

If usability is lacking, users may struggle to find information, interact with the design, or interpret tasks, leading to frustration and disengagement.

# Navigation

<img src="/img/navigation.png" alt="Navigation" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Navigation refers to the way users move through a design and access different sections or features
- Clear and intuitive navigation helps users find information quickly and easily
- It includes elements such as menus, buttons, and links that guide users through the design
- Sometimes clear sections and subsections contribute to navigation, as they help users understand the structure of the content

If navigation is unclear or difficult to use, users may become frustrated and abandon the design, leading to a poor user experience.

# Interactivity

<img src="/img/interactivity.png" alt="Interactivity" style="background-color: #fff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 40%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

- Interactivity refers to the ability of users to engage with a design and manipulate elements to explore data or information
- It includes features such as hover effects, clickable elements, and dynamic content that respond to user actions
- Effective interactivity enhances user engagement and allows users to explore data in a more meaningful way

If interactivity is poorly implemented or overly complex, it can lead to confusion and frustration, detracting from the overall user experience. Users may gain inaccurate or misleading information from poorly designed interactive elements, leading to misinterpretation of the data.

# Your Turn

- Write your own 1 sentence definitions for each design principle
- Identify:
    1. A design principle you still need more clarification on
    2. A design principle you feel confident about
    3. A design principle you feel is especially important for your SAT. Explain why that might be especially important for your visualisation
