# Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017
*Sections 26WE, 26WF, 26WH, 26WK, 26WL, 26WR*

The Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 amends the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to require certain organisations to notify about data breaches. This applies to the same entities that are covered by the *Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)*.

- If an entity has reasonable grounds to believe that it has experienced an eligible data breach, it must promptly notify individuals and the Commissioner about the breach, unless an exception applies.
- In contrast, if an entity suspects that it may have experienced an eligible data breach, it must quickly assess the situation to decide whether or not there has been an eligible data breach.
- An assessment must be reasonable and expeditious, and entities may develop their own procedures for assessing a suspected data breach.

# What is an eligible data breach?

An eligible data breach occurs when:

1. there is unauthorised access to, or unauthorised disclosure of, personal information held by an entity; or a person holding personal information on behalf of an entity is subject to a cyber attack
2. this is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates
3. the entity has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action.

# Why does this law exist?

The Notifiable Data Breaches scheme aims to:
- encourage entities to take steps to protect personal information
- ensure that individuals are notified when there is a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm, so they can take steps to protect themselves
- provide a clear and consistent framework for data breach notification.
- enhance the accountability of entities that hold personal information.

# Ethics of Data Breaches

- Just because the law does not require notification, does not mean that it is ethical to withhold information about a data breach.
- Organisations who knowlingly withhold information about a data breach are likely to lose the trust of their users, customers, and stakeholders.
- Most people would feel that not notifying people about a data breach would be unethical, even if it was not legally required.

# Summary

- When organisations suspect a data breach, they must quickly assess the situation to determine if it is an eligible data breach.
- If an eligible data breach is confirmed, they must promptly notify affected individuals and the Commissioner, unless an exception applies.
- The scheme aims to protect individuals' personal information and enhance the accountability of entities that hold such information.
- When legal requirements do not apply, ethical considerations may still guide decisions about notifying individuals of data breaches.
