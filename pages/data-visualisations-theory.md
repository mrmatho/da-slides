# Data Visualisations Theory


---
layout: center

# From the study design: 

- **purposes of data visualisations, including:**
    - exploratory data analysis
    - presentation of information
    - providing interactive experiences for users to explore data

- **formats and conventions applied to data visualisations to improve their effectiveness for intended users, including:**
    - use of colours, fonts, images and icons
    - visual hierarchy and clarity of message

- **techniques for testing data visualisations, including:**
    - visual inspection of the appearance of the data visualisation
    - confirming that charts and graphs are representative of the data being visualised.

# Review: Purposes of data visualisations

- **Exploratory data analysis**: Using visualisation techniques to explore and understand data, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships. 
    - Eg. When we created scatter plots for correlations and histograms for data shape and skew,.
- **Presentation of information**: Using visualisation techniques to present data clearly and effectively, communicating analysis results to stakeholders or decision-makers. 
    - Eg. Most of the visualisations we have created so far
- **Providing interactive experiences for users to explore data**: Using visualisation techniques to allow user interaction with data, including filtering, zooming, and panning. 
    - Eg. The Streamlit app for the meteorites dataset.

Outlines why the types of data visualisations were used. | Uses functions, formats and conventions to create effective data visualisations that explain identified trends, relationships and patterns.  Explains why the types of data visualisations were used. |  <span v-mark.highlight.green> Uses and justifies functions, formats and conventions to create effective data visualisations that clearly communicates and displays all findings. <br /> Justifies the use of the types of data visualisations selected. </span> | 

In the SAC, you will need to create your interactive data dashboard and explain what makes it effective, including selection of data visualisations.

# What Makes Visualisations Effective?

- **Use of colours, fonts, images and icons**: The choice of colours, fonts, images, and icons can significantly impact the effectiveness of a data visualisation. 
    - Eg. Using contrasting colours to highlight important data points or using icons to represent specific categories.
    - Choosing colours that are accessible to all users, but also representative of the data being visualised when possible.
- **Visual hierarchy and clarity of message**: The visual hierarchy of a data visualisation refers to the arrangement of elements in a way that guides the viewer's eye and helps them understand the message being conveyed.
    - Eg. Using size, colour, and placement to create a clear hierarchy of information.
    - Ensuring that the message is clear and easy to understand, avoiding clutter and unnecessary complexity.
- **Images and icons**: Using relevant and appropriate images and icons can enhance the visual appeal of a data visualisation and help convey the message more effectively.
    - Eg. Using icons to represent different categories or using images to provide context for the data being visualised.
