# Primer

## 2023, Section A - Question 7

A school was concerned about their students’ poor academic results and was proposing a research question
to investigate. School leaders had initial ideas about how the time spent by students playing video games
impacted their sleep.

**Which of the following is the best research question to pursue?**

<ol type="A">
    <li>Are video games and lack of sleep bad for study results?</li>
    <li v-mark.highlight.yellow >What is the impact of playing video games on academic results?</li>
    <li>Do students who play video games at night and have reduced sleep get lower academic results?</li>
    <li>Can students who play console games achieve higher results than those who play online computer games?</li>
</ol>

<v-click>*From the examiner's report:* A research question must start with ‘What’, ‘Why’ or ‘How’. B is the only response that does this.</v-click>

# What could our SAC research question have been?

- We studied pedestrian traffic patterns in Melbourne.

# Research Questions

- A research question is clear, focused, and concise, guiding your research.
- It should be broad enough for various data collection methods but specific enough to be answerable within the project scope.
