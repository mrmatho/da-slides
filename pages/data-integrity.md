# Data Integrity

Data integrity refers to the trustworthiness and consistency of data. Data without integrity can cause huge issues in data analytics: including forming incorrect conclusions, making wrong decisions, and losing money. Data integrity is a critical aspect of data management.

The Study Design identifies 6 characteristics of data integrity:

1. Accuracy
2. Authenticity
3. Correctness
4. Reasonableness
5. Relevance
6. Timeliness

## Accuracy

Accuracy refers to the degree of precision of the data. Accurate data is specific and correct. For example, a survey question asking for the age of a respondent should be answered with a specific number (e.g., 25) rather than a range (e.g., 20-30).

When data is not accurate, it can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions. For example, if a survey question asks for the age of a respondent and the respondent answers with a range (e.g., 20-30), the data may be inaccurate and lead to incorrect conclusions about the age distribution of the population.


## Authenticity

Authenticity of data refers to the degree to which the data comes from a reliable source. Authentic data is original and has not been altered or tampered with. For example weather data measured by the Bureau of Meteorology would be considered more authentic than weather data measured by your Grandfather's cheap thermometer. When data is not authentic, it is more likely to be prone to errors, assumptions and bias.

## Correctness

The correctness of data refers to the degree to which the data is free from errors. Incorrect data might be caused by human error (such as typos), technical error (such as a faulty sensor), or bias (such as a survey question that is leading). Correctness is the most basic characteristic of data integrity and it can be the most difficult to achieve.


## Reasonableness

Reasonableness of data refers to the degree to which the data is logical and makes sense. Reasonable data is consistent with what is expected and does not contain unexplained outliers or anomalies. 

The reasonableness of data is most often assessed through validation checks at the point of input. For example, a survey question asking for the age of a respondent should be answered with a number between 0 and 120. If a respondent answers with a number outside of this range (e.g., 150), the data is not reasonable and should be flagged for review.

## Relevance

Data needs to be relevant for it to have integrity. Relevance refers to the degree to which the data is applicable to the way it is being used. If data is not relevant its inclusion in an analysis might mislead that analysis. 

## Timeliness

The timeliness of data refers to the degree to which the data is up-to-date and current. Timely data is relevant to the time period being analyzed and is available at the point it is needed. When data is not timely it results in out of data conclusions and decisions.
