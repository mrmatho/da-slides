# Do Now: Revision

1. Identify and briefly describe three of the emerging trends in cyber security we studied in last lesson.
2. Write as many of the design principles for data visualisations as you can remember.
3. What are the four stages of the Problem Solving Methodology?
4. Michael is a medical receptionist entering a patient's existing medications into a new database system. He is having trouble reading a patient's handwriting as he enters their medication into the system. Identify the most relevant characteristic of data integrity that is being compromised in this scenario.

# From the Study Design:

- criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of data and information security strategies, including: 
  -	confidentiality
  -	integrity
  -	availability

# Evaluation Criteria - A reminder

- Evaluation Criteria are the standards or benchmarks used to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a system, process, or strategy.
- In the context of data and information security, evaluation criteria help determine how well security measures protect data from threats and vulnerabilities.
- The study design focuses on **effectiveness** measures, using the **CIA Triad**:
    - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.
    - **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized modifications.
    - **Availability**: Ensuring that data and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.

# Evaluating Security Strategies

When evaluating, the goal is to assess how well a security strategy is working. That's difficult to do: the clearest evaluation of security comes when it fails. 

Instead, we evaluate based on how well the strategy meets best practices and standards for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Wherever possible we want to make sure our criteria can be **measured objectively** and have **evidence** to back them up.

# Confidentiality Criteria

- Are access controls in place to restrict data access to authorized users only?
- Is sensitive data encrypted both in transit and at rest?
- Are there policies and procedures for handling sensitive information?
- Are employees trained on data privacy and confidentiality best practices?
- Is there a process for regularly reviewing and updating access permissions?

# Integrity Criteria

- Are there mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized data modifications?
- Is there a process for regular data backups and recovery?
- Are audit logs maintained to track data access and changes?
- Are data validation checks in place to ensure data accuracy and consistency?
- Are there procedures for handling data breaches or integrity violations?

# Availability Criteria

- Are there measures to protect against denial-of-service attacks?
- Is there a complete and up-to-date *disaster recovery plan* in place to ensure data availability during emergencies? 
    - Remember the disaster recovery plan should include evacuation, backup, recovery, communication and testing. 
- Are systems and applications regularly updated and patched to prevent vulnerabilities?
- Is there *redundancy* in critical systems to prevent single points of failure?
- Are there monitoring systems in place to detect and respond to availability issues promptly?

# Performing the Evaluation on a Case Study

When evaluating a security strategy, you need to:

1. Identify the security measures in place.
2. Select the relevant criteria  confidentiality, integrity, and availability
3. Assess each measure against selected criteria.
3. Describe the evidence used (or you would use) to support your assessment (e.g., audit logs, access control lists, encryption methods).
4. Identify any gaps or weaknesses in the security strategy.
5. Provide recommendations for improvement based on your evaluation.

# Questions

1. What are the three main components of the CIA Triad used to evaluate data and information security strategies?
2. BioMed Solutions has created a new database system that stores genetic information from patients. Describe one criteria for each of the parts of the CIA Triad that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the security strategy for this database system.
3. Explain why it is important to have objective measures and evidence when evaluating the effectiveness of a data and information security strategy.
