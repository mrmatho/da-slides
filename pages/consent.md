# Collecting data with informed consent

---
layout: center

# Consent

Consent means asking people for permission to use their data. We need consent for legal and ethical reasons. People should know what they are agreeing to. They should also know they can change their mind at any time.

## Informed Consent

When you collect data from individuals, you must demonstrate that you have obtained their informed consent. This means that you have provided them with enough information about the data collection process, including how their data will be **used, stored, and shared**. You should also inform them of their rights regarding their data, including the right to withdraw consent at any time.

# Surveys - Writing a Consent Statement

When writing a consent statement for a survey, you should include the following elements:

- **Purpose**: Explain why you are collecting the data and how it will be used.
- **Voluntary Participation**: Make it clear that participation is voluntary and that individuals can withdraw at any time without penalty.
- **Confidentiality**: Explain how you will protect the confidentiality of the data and the individuals involved.
- **Risks and Benefits**: Describe any potential risks or benefits of participation.
- **Contact Information**: Provide contact information for individuals who have questions or concerns about the study.
- **Data Retention and Disposal**: Explain how long the data will be retained and how it will be disposed of after the study is complete.

# Consent in Interviews and Observations

When conducting interviews or observations, you should also obtain informed consent from participants. This can be done through a verbal consent or through a written consent form. Consent should include the same elements as a survey consent statement, but it may also include additional information about the interview or observation process. Be as specific with participants as possible about what you will be doing and how their data will be used.

In instances where you are observing individuals in a public space, you may not need (or be able) to obtain explicit consent. However, it is still important to inform individuals that they are being observed and to respect their privacy.

# Writing Survey and Interview Questions

Surveys and interviews are two common methods of data collection. The quality of data collected depends almost entirely on the quality of the questions asked. Writing effective survey and interview questions is a skill that can be developed with practice.

::left::

## Survey Questions

- Your questions must be self-explanatory - you cannot be there to explain them.
- Think carefully about the types of responses you want: don't give people a choice of answers that doesn't include their own.
- Use open-ended questions when you want to encourage detailed responses.
- Use closed-ended questions when you want to gather specific information.

::right::

## Interview Questions

- Plan your questions in advance, but be ready to include follow-up questions based on the interviewee's responses.
- Use open-ended questions to encourage discussion and exploration of the topic.
- Don't include too many closed questions, as they can limit the depth of the conversation.
- Be prepared to explain your questions and clarify any misunderstandings.

Students needed to explain why cleansing is a necessary process. To gain full marks, students needed to mention removing incomplete, inaccurate or irrelevant data as well as explain why this is an important process to complete.
Data cleansing is the process of identifying and correcting errors within a dataset, such as incomplete, inaccurate or irrelevant data points. This is an important aspect of data manipulation and analysis because it helps to ensure that data can be summarised and analysed accurately

- Removing blank spaces - This type of cleansing removes extra spaces within text that could affect readability.
    - Example: Removing extra spaces between words in a cell, such as between first name and last name, or between the street number and street name in an address.
- Editing text to upper or lower case - This type of cleansing improves the readability of text by having the correct case for letters in words.
    - Example: Ensuring the first letter of the first name, last name, or address is uppercase and all other letters are lowercase.
- Spell check - This type of cleansing ensures the correct spelling of names, events, and places.
    - Example: Spell checking to ensure events have the correct spelling, such as "Long Jump" or "High Jump".
- Find and replace - This type of cleansing is a way to find all examples of a word or number and replace them with another word or number. It is an efficient way of editing data.
    - Example: If an athlete's name was entered incorrectly, find and replace would enable the original spelling to be corrected in all instances it was found.
