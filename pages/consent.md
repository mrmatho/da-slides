# Consent

Consent means asking people for permission to use their data. We need consent for legal and ethical reasons. People should know what they are agreeing to. They should also know they can change their mind at any time.

## Informed Consent

When you collect data from individuals, you must demonstrate that you have obtained their informed consent. This means that you have provided them with enough information about the data collection process, including how their data will be **used, stored, and shared**. You should also inform them of their rights regarding their data, including the right to withdraw consent at any time.

# Surveys - Writing a Consent Statement

- **Purpose**: Explain why you are collecting the data and how it will be used.
- **Voluntary Participation**: Make it clear that participation is voluntary and that individuals can withdraw at any time without penalty.
- **Confidentiality**: Explain how you will protect the confidentiality of the data and the individuals involved.
- **Risks and Benefits**: Describe any potential risks or benefits of participation.
- **Contact Information**: Provide contact information for individuals who have questions or concerns about the study.

# Consent in Interviews and Observations

When conducting interviews or observations, you should also obtain informed consent from participants. This can be done through a verbal consent or through a written consent form. Consent should include the same elements as a survey consent statement, but it may also include additional information about the interview or observation process. Be as specific with participants as possible about what you will be doing and how their data will be used.

In instances where you are observing individuals in a public space, you may not need (or be able) to obtain explicit consent. However, it is still important to inform individuals that they are being observed and to respect their privacy.
