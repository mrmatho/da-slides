- **Moral Rights**: Creators have the right to be named as the author and to keep their work unchanged.
- **Fair Dealing**: You can use copyrighted material without permission for specific purposes like research, criticism, educational use or news reporting.

- **Infringement**: Using someone else's work without permission can lead to legal action.

# So how does Copyright affect Data Analytics?

- In how we produce Data Visualisations
    - Finding the right balance between being inspired by existing works and still creating original content
    - Only using images and text that we have the right to use (e.g., Creative Commons licensed, public domain, or our own work)

<div class="note">

The Copyright Act is mentioned in the Unit 3 study design but not in Unit 4. We have included it here for reference.

# Health Records Act 2001 (HPP 1, 2, 4)

# Privacy Act 1988 (Cwlth) (APP 3, 4, 5, 6, 11)

The Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) sets out the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that govern how personal information is handled by Australian government agencies and some private sector organisations.

::left::

It applies to:
- All Australian Government agencies
- All organisations contracting with the Australian Government
- Private sector organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million
- Private health service providers
- Credit reporting agencies
- Any business that trades in personal information in Australia

::right::

For data analytics, the most relevant Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) are:
- **APP 3**: Collection of solicited personal information
- **APP 4**: Dealing with unsolicited personal information
- **APP 5**: Notification of the collection of personal information
- **APP 6**: Use or disclosure of personal information
- **APP 11**: Security of personal information

# APP 3 - Collection of Solicited Personal Information

- An organisation may only collect *personal information* that is reasonably necessary for its functions or activities.
- An organisation may only collect *sensitive information*  with the individual's consent, or if it is required by law.

| Personal Information | Sensitive Information |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Information about an identifiable individual**. Eg. Address, phone, name, signature, employee record, IP address | Information or an opinion about an individual's: racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, health information, genetic information, biometric information. |

# APP 4 - Dealing with Unsolicited Personal Information

Unsolicited personal information is information that an organisation receives that it *has not taken active steps* to collect.

- If an organisation receives unsolicited personal information, it must determine whether it could have collected the information under APP 3.
- If it could not have collected the information, it must destroy or de-identify the information as soon as practicable, unless it is required to keep it as a "Commonwealth record" under the Archives Act 1983.

This APP is much more complicated. But basically - if you get personal information you did not ask for, you need to check if you could have collected it. If not, you need to delete it.

# APP 5 - Notification of the Collection of Personal Information

- An organisation must take reasonable steps to notify an individual of the collection of their personal information, including:
    - The purpose of collection
    - The consequences of not providing the information
    - Any third parties to whom the information may be disclosed
- If the information is collected from a third party, the organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual is aware of the collection.

<div class="note">

Most organisations use a privacy policy to notify individuals of the collection of their personal information. This is often available on their website.

# APP 6 - Use or Disclosure of Personal Information

- An organisation may only use or disclose personal information for the purpose for which it was collected, unless:
    - The individual has consented to the use or disclosure
    - The use or disclosure is required by law
    - The use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to life, health, safety or welfare of an individual or the public.

<div class="note">

This is similar to HPP 2, but applies to all personal information, not just health information.

# APP 11 - Security of Personal Information

- An organisation must take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
- If an organisation no longer needs personal information for the purpose for which it was collected, it must take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify it.

<div class="note">

This is similar to HPP 4, but applies to all personal information, not just health information.

# Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (IPP 1, 2, 4, 10)

The Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic) sets out the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) that govern how personal information is handled by Victorian public sector organisations. These principles are similar to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) but are specific to Victoria.

It applies to:

- All Victorian public sector organisations (including local councils, state government departments, and public hospitals)
- Any private sector organisation that provides services to a Victorian public sector organisation

For data analytics, the most relevant Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) are:

- **IPP 1**: Collection of personal information --> Mirrors personal information collection in APP 3
- **IPP 2**: Use and disclosure of personal information --> Mirrors APP 6
- **IPP 4**: Data security -> Mirrors APP 11
- **IPP 10**: Sensitive information -> Mirrors sensitive information collection in APP 3

# Summary of Privacy Legislation

The main differences between the 3 pieces of legislation are:

| Legislation | Scope | Applies to |  Key Principles |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Health Records Act 2001 | Victoria only | Anyone in Victoria keeping health data | Collection, use, and disclosure of **health** information (HPP 1, 2, 4) |
| Privacy Act 1988 (Cwlth) | Australia-wide | Large Organisations in Australia, Federal Government and their contractors | Collection, use, and disclosure of personal information (APP 3, 4, 5, 6, 11) |
| Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 | Victoria only | Victorian Government, Councils, Anyone Contracted to them | Collection, use, and disclosure of personal information (IPP 1, 2, 4, 10) |

<div class="note">

This study design is the first time they have mentioned specific HPPs, APPs and IPPs. This might just be to be clear about what parts of the law are relevant, but it is not impossible that they want you to know which ones are which. (I hope they don't)
