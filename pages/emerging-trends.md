# Emerging Trends in Data Security and Privacy
*From the 2024 VCE Data Analytics Study Design*

- emerging trends in cyber security, including:
    - the use of artificial intelligence to protect data
    - authentication procedures
    - threat detection and response
    - analytics of user behaviour
    - privacy protection

# Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security

- AI can help identify and respond to threats more quickly and accurately than traditional methods.
- AI can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security breach.
- AI can also help automate routine security tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex tasks.

# Authentication Procedures

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is becoming increasingly common, requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification to access sensitive data.
- Biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, is also being used more frequently.
- Passwordless authentication methods, such as using a mobile device or hardware token, are also gaining popularity.
- These methods help to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

# Threat Detection and Response

- Advanced threat detection systems use machine learning and AI to identify potential threats in real-time.
- These systems can analyze network traffic, user behavior, and other data to identify potential threats.
- Automated response systems can quickly respond to threats, such as isolating infected devices or blocking malicious traffic.
- This helps to minimize the impact of security breaches and reduce the time it takes to respond to threats.

# Analytics of User Behaviour

- User behavior analytics (UBA) uses machine learning to analyze user behavior and identify potential security threats.
- UBA can identify unusual behavior, such as accessing sensitive data at odd hours or from unusual locations.
- This helps to identify potential insider threats and other security risks.
- UBA can also help to improve overall security by identifying areas where users may need additional training or support.

# Privacy Protection

- Privacy protection is becoming increasingly important as more data is collected and stored online.
- Techniques such as data anonymization and encryption are being used to protect sensitive data.
- Organizations are also implementing privacy by design principles, which involve considering privacy at every stage of the data lifecycle.
