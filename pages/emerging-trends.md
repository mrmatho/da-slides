# Emerging Trends in Cyber Security

*From the 2024 VCE Data Analytics Study Design*

- emerging trends in cyber security, including:
    - the use of artificial intelligence to protect data
    - authentication procedures
    - threat detection and response
    - analytics of user behaviour
    - privacy protection

# Use of Artificial Intelligence to Protect Data

- AI can analyze large amounts of data to identify *patterns and anomalies* that may indicate a security breach.
    - Identifying unusual login locations or times.
    - Working through vast log files of network traffic to spot potential threats.
- AI tools used to identify anomolies in data records that may indicate fraud or other malicious activity.
    - Looking for unusual transactions or changes to account information.
- AI can predict potential threats based on historical data, allowing organizations to proactively address vulnerabilities.

# Authentication Procedures

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is becoming increasingly common, requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification to access sensitive data.
- Biometric authentication:
    - fingerprint scanning
    - facial recognition
    - voice recognition
- Passwordless authentication methods
    - Mobile device authentication apps
    - Text message or email one-time codes
    - Hardware tokens

# Threat Detection and Response

- Advanced threat detection systems use machine learning and AI to identify potential threats in real-time.
- These systems can analyze network traffic, user behavior, and other data to identify potential threats.
- **Automated response systems** can quickly respond to threats, such as isolating infected devices or blocking malicious traffic.
- This helps to minimize the impact of security breaches and reduce the time it takes to respond to threats.

# Analytics of User Behaviour

- User behavior analytics (UBA) uses machine learning or manual data analysis to review user behavior and identify potential security threats.
- UBA can identify unusual behavior, such as accessing sensitive data at odd hours or from unusual locations.
- This helps to identify potential insider threats and other security risks.
- UBA can also help to improve overall security by identifying areas where users may need additional training or support.

# Privacy Protection

- Privacy protection is becoming increasingly important as more data is collected and stored online.
- Techniques such as data anonymization and encryption are being used to protect sensitive data.
- Organisations are also implementing privacy by design principles, which involve considering privacy at every stage of the data lifecycle.
