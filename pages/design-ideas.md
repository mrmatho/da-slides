# Generating Design Ideas

- Generating design ideas is the process of brainstorming and developing ideas for a data analysis project.
- Though this might be something you might normally do informally or instinctively, for the purposes of this course, we will be using a more structured, documented process to generate design ideas.
- The methods we use in Data Analytics are:
    - **Mood Boards**
    - **Brainstorming**
    - **Mind Maps**
    - **Sketching**

# Mood Boards

- A mood board is a visual collage of images, text, and samples of objects in a composition.
- Mood boards are used to convey a general idea or feeling about a particular topic.
- Mood boards are often used in design projects to help communicate the overall look and feel of a project.

- Mood boards can be used to help generate ideas for a data analysis project by:
    - Providing inspiration
    - Helping to clarify the overall vision for the project
    - Communicating ideas to others

## How can I create a mood board?

- You can create a mood board using a variety of tools, including:
    - Canva
    - Photoshop
    - Google Slides
    - Microsoft PowerPoint

- You could also create a mood board using physical materials, such as:
    - Magazines

# Brainstorming

- Brainstorming is a method of generating ideas by encouraging free thinking and the exploration of different possibilities.
- Brainstorming is often done in a group setting, but can also be done individually.
- The goal of brainstorming is to generate as many ideas as possible, without worrying about whether they are good or bad.
- Brainstorming can be done in a variety of ways, including:
    - Writing down ideas on sticky notes
    - Using a whiteboard or flip chart
    - Using a mind mapping tool
    - Using a brainstorming app

::right::

## Brainstorming Design Ideas

- Focus on generating as many ideas as possible
- Generate ideas about the following:
    - What data do you have?
    - What questions do you want to answer?
    - What insights do you want to gain?
    - How might you structure your data?
    - What visualizations might be useful?
- Getting the ideas down on paper is more important than the quality of the ideas

# Mind Maps

- A mind map is a visual representation of ideas and concepts.
- Mind maps are used to organize information and show relationships between different ideas.
- Mind maps can help to organize your brainstorming ideas or to help identify new ideas through the process of mapping out your thoughts.
- Mind maps can be created using a variety of tools, including:
    - Pen and paper
    - Online mind mapping tools (e.g., MindMeister, XMind, MermaidJS[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/mindmap?id=mindmap])

::right::

# Mind Mapping Design Ideas

- Start with a central idea or topic
- Identify key concepts or ideas you need to explore with your analysis
- Create branches for each key concept or idea
- Add sub-branches for related ideas or concepts

# Sketching

- Sketching is a method of generating ideas by drawing or doodling.
- You can sketch your ideas digitally or on paper.
- Sketching can help to visualize your ideas and make them more concrete.
- Sketching gives you the freedom to explore different ideas and concepts without worrying about making them perfect.

# How do I need to show my design idea generation for the SAT?

- Proof of using these techniques is required in Criterion 4
- Using 1-2 of these techniques is sufficient for an S, but at least 3 techniques are required for the higher grades
- For the 9-10 grade you must show evidence of **feasible, original and distinctive** design ideas across **database (SQL), spreadsheet and the final product** (infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations)

|7–8 (high) | 9–10 (very high) |
|---|---|
| Generates design ideas that represent the infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations solutions using three or more of the following ideation tools and techniques  <br> • mood boards <br> • brainstorming <br> • mind maps <br> • sketches. <br> Uses annotations to explain the appearance and functionality of the software solutions. |  Generates feasible, original and distinctive design ideas using ideation tools and techniques that fully represent the: <br> • database (SQL) <br> • spreadsheet <br> • infographics and/or dynamic data visualisations. <br> Uses annotations to describe and justify the appearance and functionality of the software solutions. |
