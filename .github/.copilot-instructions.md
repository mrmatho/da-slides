# Copilot Instructions for Data Analytics Slides Project

## Project Overview
This is a Slidev-based presentation project for data analytics education. It contains educational slides about data analysis, databases, spreadsheets, data visualization, and research methods. These slides are being used in the VCE Applied Computing: Data Analytics course.

## Technology Stack
- **Slidev**: Vue-powered presentation framework
- **Vue 3**: Frontend framework 
- **UnoCSS**: Atomic CSS framework for styling
- **Markdown**: Content format for slides
- **TypeScript**: For components and theme customization

## Content Guidelines

### Slide Content
- Focus on data analytics education topics
- Wherever possible reference the VCE Applied Computing Study Design
- Refer to VCE Applied Computing: Data Analytics for relevant content
- Keep content clear and beginner-friendly
- Use bullet points and concise explanations
- Include practical examples and activities
- Add exam questions and marking criteria when relevant

### Markdown Conventions
- Use frontmatter for slide configuration:
  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: center
  transition: fade
  hideInToc: false
  title: Slide Title
  ---
  ```
- Use `##` for slide sections, `#` for main headings
- Bold important terms with `**text**`
- Use `<div class="note">` for highlighted content boxes

### Layout Usage
- `layout: cover` - Title slides
- `layout: center` - Content slides
- `layout: two-cols-header` - Two-column content
- `layout: default` - Standard layout
- `layout: li` - Learning intentions and success criteria. Should have `::li::` and `::sc::` for learning intentions and success criteria respectively.

## Styling Guidelines

### UnoCSS Classes
- Use `--uno: 'class-name'` syntax in CSS
- Common patterns:
  - `bg-yellow-200 dark:bg-yellow-800` for highlights
  - `font-serif` for serif fonts
  - `text-center` for centering

### Custom CSS Classes
- `.note` - Yellow highlighted content boxes
- `.col-left` / `.col-right` - Styled columns
- Styling for `strong`, `em`, `a` elements with color coding

## Component Development
- Create Vue components in `/components/` directory
- Use simple, educational-focused components
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Keep components reusable across slides

## Content Creation Best Practices

### Educational Content
- Start with clear learning objectives
- Provide step-by-step explanations
- Include practical activities and exercises
- Add "Your Turn" sections for student engagement
- Reference real exam questions and marking criteria

### Data Analytics Topics
- Cover core concepts: databases, spreadsheets, visualization
- Include consent and ethical considerations
- Provide practical examples and case studies
- Connect theory to real-world applications

### Slide Design
- Use consistent layouts and styling
- Include relevant images in `/public/img/`
- Keep text readable with appropriate font sizes
- Use color coding for different content types

## Development Workflow
- Run `npm run dev` for local development
- Test slides in presentation mode
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Export to PDF with `npm run export`

## Code Style
- Use meaningful file names for slide modules
- Keep individual slide files focused on single topics
- Comment complex Vue components
- Use TypeScript for type safety where applicable

## Content Maintenance
- Update exam questions to current years
- Refresh examples and case studies regularly
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test all interactive elements

## When Adding New Content
1. Create new `.md` files in `/pages/` directory
2. Add to main `slides.md` with `src:` directive
3. Use appropriate layouts and styling
4. Include practical activities where relevant
5. Test in both light and dark modes

Remember: This is an educational resource focused on making data analytics concepts accessible to students. Prioritize clarity, engagement, and practical application in all content creation.
